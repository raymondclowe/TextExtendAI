It costs money, but not that much so make sure you set a suitable [monthly usage limit](https://console.mistral.ai/billing/#:~:text=next%20month%20begins.-,Usage%20limit%20(%E2%82%AC)%20*,-Update%20limit) (like â‚¬1 / month) and you will be fine.

# Usage

In the editor put your cursor at the end of, or after, any block where you want to write more.

Press Ctrl-Shift-E for "Extend".

As noted the first time it will ask for a key, that key will be saved locally on your browser in localstorage and will not be saved anywhere else. So make a record of it.

Any subsequent times you press Ctrl-Shift-E then the text you have written so far is sent to Mistral and the response is inserted.

It takes about 2 seconds.
